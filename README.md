# DataCenterForIsp  

## Overview  
**DataCenterForIsp** is an open-source project by **Neural Networks**, led by **Umar Ayub**. This project aims to create a **spatial pattern/identity** for data centers, enabling ISPs to efficiently **generate, manage, and sell data-driven services**.  

🚀 **Neural Networks' Mission:** *Empowering human resources with innovative exercises*  

## Features  
- 📌 **Spatial data organization** for optimized server infrastructure.  
- ☁ **Cloud-based data generation** (Google Cloud, AWS, or self-hosted).  
- 📡 **Network integration** with MikroTik and other ISP tools.  
- 📊 **Data visualization** using Leaflet.js and mapping technologies.  
- 🔒 **Custom data licensing** to regulate data usage and distribution.  

## Technologies Used  
- **MikroTik** – Network and routing management.  
- **AWS / Google Cloud** – Cloud storage and computing.  
- **Leaflet.js** – Spatial visualization for data representation.  
- **GitHub** – Version control and collaboration.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Basic networking and ISP knowledge.  
- An active **AWS** or **Google Cloud** account.  
- A MikroTik router (optional but recommended).  

### Installation  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/neuralnetworksp001/DataCenterForIsp.git
   cd DataCenterForIsp
